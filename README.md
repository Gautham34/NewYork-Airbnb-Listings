# NewYork-Airbnb-Listings
This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the NYC Airbnb dataset to uncover key trends and patterns in pricing, availability, neighbourhoods, and room types. The analysis involves data cleaning, outlier treatment, feature engineering, and applying various visualization techniques to understand the factors that influence Airbnb listing prices.

Through univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis, the project explores neighbourhood pricing differences, the relationship between room types and availability, geographical distribution of listings, and correlations between key numerical features. These insights can support hosts, travelers, and business stakeholders in making informed, data-driven decisions within the Airbnb market.
